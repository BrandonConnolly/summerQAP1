QAP 1 for Spring-Summer Semester

Hi Peter, this is the first part of my QAP.

In this folder you will find one folder name “Objects” with files labeled which objects I have chosen to describe. Each object file has a definition I found online and my own understanding of that definition and object. If you have time please let me know if that understanding is correct or need to be adjusted.

You will also find a folder name “jsFiles” the files in this folder hold the small example codes I wrote for each of the objects. If you have time please add any notes on these lines of code that you might see need improving.

Lastly to comment on this semester and how the courses and classes are going, I will say there is a noticed difference in structure and planning in this semester then the previous. For the first time in this program, I feel like there is a clear vision of what information and skills are needed to be relayed to us in each lesson and we are being shown a very clearly the path on how to us them. Also, the amount of recourses and prep we have been given for each less has been noticeable larger and more detailed. Even the structure of this QAP is smaller and gives clear instructions on what we need to know and if we don’t how to find it while not overwhelming us with weeks of topics.

So to summarise I think each course and semester should be laid out in a similar fashion and would really help students grasp topics easier and give them a clearer understanding of expectations.
